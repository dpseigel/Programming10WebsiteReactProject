                <p>
                    The programming class at Stem Innovation Academy is a course that teaches us the basics of programming such as using variables and if statements and creating functions.
                    We learned a couple different languages such as python and javascript. We also learned how to create basic websites with html and css.
                    We added some interactivity to our website using javascript.
