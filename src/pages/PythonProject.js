                    <p>
                        In programming class, we were tasked with creating a game using python and a library called
                        processing.
                        This allowed us to learn the basics of programming in a interactive way.
                        We learned how to use variables and if statements to create interactive animations.
                        We then furthered our understanding of programming by using functions and for loops to make more
                        complex animations.
                        Then, using the functions of the processing library, we were able to create somewhat complex
                        games using input from the mouse position and keyboard inputs.
                        This is the game that I had created to demonstrate my understanding of the programming we
                        learned in class.
